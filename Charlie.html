<p> Charlie is an eight year old Shetland Sheepdog, and he lives in Austin, Texas. He lives with his mom and dad, his four sisters, and one brother. His sisters have two legs, but his brother has four legs.
</p>
<p> Charlie's hobbies include snacking, napping, sunbathing, and looking pretty. He is often confused for a human, because his demeanor could not be less dog like.
