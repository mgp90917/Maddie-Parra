<tr><td> <h1> The Golden Ginko </h1>
<p>The ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba) is a medium-sized tree native to the Orient, but widely planted in the Southestern US. The ginkgo is considered a “living fossil,”in that there are no closely related speciesstill extant. Ginkgos are prized for their vivid yellow fall leaves.
</p>
<p>An unusual biological feature of the ginkgo is that it is a gymnosperm (“naked seed”), meaning that the ginkgo seed is not encased in a fruit. In this the ginkgo resembles pine trees, although the ginkgo is deciduous (loses its leaves in the winter).
</p>Ginkgos can be extremely long lived; one ginkgo in Shandong province, China is estimated to be 3,000 years old.
