<tr><td> <h1> Charlie Parra </h1>
<p> Charlie is an eight year old Shetland Sheepdog, and he lives in Austin, Texas. He lives with his mom and dad, his four sisters, and one brother. His sisters have two legs, but his brother has four legs. Charlie loves his family, and he will do anything to spend as much time with them as possible.
</p>
<p> Charlie was actually bred to be a show dog, but his tail was too long to make the cut (he was happy with this decision though). Charlie's hobbies include snacking, napping, sunbathing, and looking pretty. He is often confused for a human, because his demeanor could not be less dog like. Since the day be became part of the Parra family, he has pranced instead of walked and crossed his paws every time he laid down.  
</p> Sadly, Charlie started having seizures this fall. After taking him to the vet, his parents were informed that he had brain cancer and had 3-12 months to live. This shocked Charlie's family, because their last sheltie lived to be 16. After thinking it over for a few weeks, Charlie's parents decided that they would do radiation treatment for Charlie to prolong his life. This treatment has definitely helped him, and he is doing much better
